Requirements
Your site must have the following behavior:

Anyone can visit the root page and see a list of all the posts
Anyone can click on a post to view its comments
Only a logged in user can submit a new post
Only a logged in user can comment on a post
Only the owner/creator of a post can edit that post
Only the owner/creator of a post can delete that post
Only the owner/creator of a comment can edit that comment
Only the owner/creator of a comment can delete that comment
The specific models, routing, and views are completely up to you. With that said, this assignment is meant to build on all the things you've been learning up to this point: authentication, nested routes, model associations, etc.

Styling
Styling is not a huge component of this project, but feel free to make your site look nice. Add Bootstrap, Foundation, or roll your own styling from scratch. Don't stress out about it, though. I want you to focus mainly on the back-end logic.

Bonus Features
Completely optional, challenging features to add after you finish the basic functionality:

Add the ability to comment on another comment. Hint: look into polymorpism
Add subreddits
